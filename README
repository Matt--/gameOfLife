 Game of Life

 ** Author Matt Stevens, done as a coding exercise to get familiar with Ruby March 2014

 ** To run, use the command line. Navigate to the directory this file is in and type in;
ruby gameOfLife.rb

 ** Pre-requisites
You need Ruby installed - visit the Ruby programming language website 
A unix bash style terminal. If running Windows you need Cygwin - visit the Cygwin website
If you find your terminal screen is not clearing between frames, you also need
'ncurses' installed to Cygwin, it contains the 'clear' command that is used. - google for the how to.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

 ** Design decisions
 I didn't want an infinite surface, so surrounded the surface with a one cell wide dead zone. Gliders, etc will hit this and die.
 Tied in with the dead zone is a 10 cell wide, hidden zone. Partly so the dead zone doea not influence the game. 10 cells is overkill, but handy when trying to balance how large the surface should be based on the first few observations of the game.
 Everything is in this one file. Its only ~200 lines of code,plus patterns, plus comments. It just seemed tidier.
 Adding a file reader might be an idea if you want to extrend this, Wikipedia and possibly other places have txt files with interesting patterns. A file reader would make using them easy.

These are notes from a file that helped to me get started.
